          Dear CorkJS Members,
          <br>
          Two months CorkJS meetup was rebooted.
          <br>
          Our current attendance record this year is eleven. Any new attendees get to introduce themselves.
          <br>
          Our current meeting format moving forward is a specific topic/speaker for the first half, and the second half is an open forum. Last time we touched briefly on micro-frontend approaches. There will be some continuity around this topic as it was a hot topic last time.
          <br>
          In the first hour, we will have a speaker talk about "Micro trends"
          <br>
          We'll briefly touch on micro-services and review a real-life microservice architecture in production.
          We'll review a micro-frontend pattern at runtime to build highly reusable feature apps or widgets
          FaaS - Feature as a Service
          We especially love to talk about real-world technical problems and how we arrived at a particular solution.
          <br>
          We're thrilled to have secured ClickDimensions' offices on Saturday for our meetings in South Mall, City Centre.
          <br>
          We'll also have plenty of time to chat about all things JavaScript/Typescript, open source, and entrepreneurship.
          <br>
        </p>
